2. This program is a spam-checker for emails. The program requires an input that ends with two consecutive
    line breaks to ensure the input isn't prematurely ended. This is a fix for past versions.

3. Variables: common_phrases, lines, line, email_content, words, total_words, spam_count, spam_phrases, likelihood.

4. Several functions: create_readable_list, get_email, count_words, compare_email, calculate_likelihood, and main.

5. Logical steps:
    1. Create a list and text file for the thirty commonly used phrases in spam emails.
    2. Ask for user's input (the e-mail). Wait for 2 consecutive blank lines to end input.
    3. Count the total number of words in the e-mail. This is for calculating the likelihood.
    4. Open the file and read each line.
    5. Convert e-mail to all lowercase for case-sensitivity.
    6. For each phrase, if the phrase is in the e-mail, add to spam count and record the found phrase.
    7. Using total words and total spam count, find the likelihood.
    8. Print spam likelihood, spam count, and recorded spam phrases.
