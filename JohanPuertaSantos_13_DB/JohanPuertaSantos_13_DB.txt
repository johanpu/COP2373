2. The purpose of this program is to simulate population growth and output the corresponding graph. It takes
    information from a pre-made list of ten Florida cities and their 2023 populations.

3. Variables: population_data, conn, cursor, city, pop, initial_pop, current_pop,
    year, results, data, years, populations, selected_city.

4. Functions: create_database, query_city, plot_population_growth, main.

5. Logical steps:
    1. Import sqlite3 and matplotlib modules.
    2. Create a list of ten Floridian cities' populations in 2023.
    3. Create SQLite database (population_JPS.db) and population table with the fields city, year, and population.
    4. Insert population data from original list to table. Simulate growth for 20 years @ 2% growth per year.
    5. Replace original values in population table. Define results variable using query_city function to
        fetch all results.
    6. Create graph plot using query results and matplotlib.
    7. Prompt the user to enter a valid city name, then query, plot, and print population growth.
