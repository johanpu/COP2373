2. This program was designed to validate the user's inputs. These inputs had to be an SSN, phone number, or zip code.

3. Variables: pattern, ssn, zip_code, phone_number

4. Functions: is_valid_ssn, is_valid_zip_code, is_valid_phone_number, main

5. Logical steps:
    1. Get user input (ssn, zip_code, phone_number) and store them in their respective variables.
    2. Call is_valid_ssn, is_valid_zip_code, and is_valid_phone_number functions to validate variables.
    3. If any return false, invalidate them and provide tips for formatting.
    4. If any return "NONE", log that it was not provided by the user.
    5. If any return true, validate them.
