2. This program is virtually an online Magic 8 Ball response generator. It prompts the user for a yes/no question
	and responses with one of twelve responses, chosen randomly.

3. Variables: user_input, random_response, and responses.

4. Three functions: write_responses_from_file, read_responses_from_file, and magic_8_ball.

5. Logical steps:
	1. Import random library for output responses.
	2. Create a list of responses and assign them to a variable.
	3. Create 8ball_responses.txt and write responses to file.
	4. Read file.
	5. Ask for user input (yes/no question or ‘quit’)
	6. End if ‘quit’, generate random response if not quit.
