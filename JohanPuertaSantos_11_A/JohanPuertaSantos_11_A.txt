2. Simulates a hand of Poker and then subsequently displays the hand before and after user replacement.

3. Variables: n_decks, cards_list, cards_in_play_list, discards_list, new_card, cards_to_replace,
    deck, hand_size, hand, pos.

4. Functions: __init__, deal, new_hand, replace_cards, simulate_replacement.

5. Logical steps:
    1. Import random module for shuffled decks.
    2. In the Deck class, define __init__, deal, new_hand, and replace_cards.
    3. If the deck is empty, then shuffle the discarded list, and copy it to card_list. Empty discards_list.
    4. From the card_list, grab one and initialize it as new_card, then return it.
    5. For preparing a new hand, clear all cards in play after adding them to the discards_list.
    6. Replace cards by removing each one from cards_in_play_list and add them to discards_list. Call deal function.
    7. Ask the user for the positions of the cards in their hands they wish to replace.
    8. If input is valid, call replace_cards and replace them with new ones from the deck.
    9. If invalid, print error message and don't replace.
