2. This program calculates the mean, median, std. dev., minimum, and the maximum of all grades for each exam
    in 'grades.csv', and then the combination of all three. It uses the NumPy library to accomplish this.

3. Variables: dtype, grades, exam1_mean, exam2_mean, exam3_mean, combined_mean,
    exam1_median, exam2_median, exam3_median, combined_median, exam1_std, exam2_std, exam3_std, combined_std,
    exam1_minimum, exam2_minimum, exam3_minimum, combined_minimum, exam1_maximum, exam2_maximum, exam3_maximum,
    combined_maximum, exam1_passing, exam2_passing, exam3_passing, pass_percentage.

4. Functions: get_data, __init__, mean, median, std_dev, minimum, maximum, determine_passing, main.
    One class (CalculateExams).

5. Logical steps:
    1. Import NumPy as np.
    2. Separate exam data into variables using dtype.
    3. Loop to open 'grades.csv'. If empty or not found, break.
    4. Define CalculateExams class and its attributes.
    5. Define mean, median, std_dev, minimum, maximum, and determine_passing functions.
    6. Get the mean, median, std. dev., minimum, and maximum from each exam in their respective functions.
    7. Get the combined mean, median, std. dev., minimum, and maximum in their respective functions.
    8. Determine which students are passing/failing each exam (passing grade >= 60).
    9. Determine overall passing percentage by adding all passes and dividing by 0.3 (total score / 100).
    10. Define main function to run the program and print all results.
