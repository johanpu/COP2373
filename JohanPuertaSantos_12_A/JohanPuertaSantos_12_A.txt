2. This program calculates the mean, median, std. dev., min, and the max of all grades for each exam in 'grades.csv',
    and then the combination of all three. It uses the NumPy library to accomplish this.

3. Variables: dtype, grades, exam1_mean, exam2_mean, exam3_mean, combined_mean,
    exam1_median, exam2_median, exam3_median, combined_median, exam1_std, exam2_std, exam3_std, combined_std,
    exam1_min, exam2_min, exam3_min, combined_min, exam1_max, exam2_max, exam3_max, combined_max,
    exam1_passing, exam2_passing, exam3_passing, pass_percentage.

4. Functions: get_data, __init__, mean, median, std_dev, min, max, determine_passing, main.
    One class (CalculateExams).

5. Logical steps:
    1. Import NumPy as np.
    2. Separate exam data into variables using dtype.
    3. Loop to open 'grades.csv'. If empty or not found, break.
    4. Define CalculateExams class and its attributes.
    5. Define mean, median, std_dev, min, max, and determine_passing functions.
    6. Get the mean, median, std. dev., min, and max from each exam in their respective functions.
    7. Get the combined mean, median, std. dev., min, and max in their respective functions.
    8. Determine which students are passing/failing each exam (passing grade >= 60).
    9. Determine overall passing percentage by adding all passes and dividing by 0.3 (total score / 100).
    10. Define main function to run the program and print all results.
