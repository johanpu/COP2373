2. This program was developed to determine the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle,
    given two pieces of information: the nearest angle (measured in degrees) and the length of the adjacent side.

3. Variables: nearest_angle, adjacent, hypotenuse.

4. Functions: input_data, calculate_hypotenuse, main.

5. Logical steps:
    1. Loop for valid angle input.
    2. Loop for valid adjacent side length input.
    3. Convert angle input to radians (math library cannot handle degrees).
    4. Calculate hypotenuse using specific formula.
    5. Print result.
