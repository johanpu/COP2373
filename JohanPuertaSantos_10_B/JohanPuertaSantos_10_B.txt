2. This program inherits the Money class from 10A and uses it to replace 9A's BankAcct class's deposit
    and withdraw methods with the add and subtract methods from Money. It then utilizes 9A's
    test function to test the new methods.

3. Variables: name, acct_num, amount, interest_rate, amount_to_withdraw, amount_to_deposit, interest,
    initial_balance, account, after_successful_wd_balance, new_rate.

4. Functions: test_bank_acct. In Money class: __add__, __sub__, __mul, __repr__. In BankAcct class: __init__,
    adjust_interest_rate, withdraw, deposit, balance, calculate_interest, __str__.

5. Logical steps:
    1. Create class to handle operations (Money).
    2. Ensure that operations can handle different types of objects.
    3. Create bank account class (BankAcct) that inherits add/sub from Money.
    4. Create test function that tests the methods in BankAcct.
    5. Initialize name, account number, initial balance, and interest rate. Randomize latter three.
    6. Perform test operations using randomized values. Test withdraw 2x to showcase insufficient funds error.
    7. Loop for new interest rate to ensure it changes.
    8. Calculate interest for 30 days at initial and new interest rate.
    9. Print all results.
